### DPLMakerspace

For the first time I feel that there is a potential to share a repo and have others edit materials in the underlying books.

The impetus for this repo is the creation of programming materials in support of the Makerspace at the Redmond branch of the Deschutes Public Library (DPL) system.  Each of the folders in this repo is imagined to be a separate book in that broader effort.
