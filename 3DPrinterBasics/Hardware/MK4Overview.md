### MK4 Overview

We will primarily focus here on the particular type of printer that is available in the Deschutes Public Library makerspaces. As our equipment changes this page will hopefully be updated to stay current.

### Current: Prusa MK4S

**Last Updated: 9/30/2025**

The Pruse MK4S with an enclosure is our current standard FDM printer in the DPL Redmond Makerspace.
