### Workflow Overview

The general workflow for additive manufacturing (3D printing) is typical of all code driven manufacturing like CNC, Cricut, Laser Cutters, CNC routers and others. For our purposes I'm going to think of the workflow as having three (3) broad stages. 

### I: Design

If you are new to 3D printing there is very little reason for you to worry about learning and using CAD soft
