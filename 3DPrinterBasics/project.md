## Why?

As all of us develop materials to support the Makerspace at the Redmond branch of the Deschutes Public Library (DPL) systen I wanted to explore using my github and JupyterBook to create documents that are easily updated and managed. I would also like it to be possible for anyone else to clone this effort or contribute to it in an ongoing. More learning on my part.

### Who is the Audience?

Deschutes County Public (patrons of the DPL system)
